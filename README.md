  <tr>
    <td>Mid-Year Volatility</td>
    <td>Performance from <strong>April to September</strong> showed repeated short-term declines and brief recoveries, indicating <strong>volatility rather than trend-driven growth</strong>.</td>

  ### Key Findings
<tr>
  <td><strong>Key Revenue Driver</strong></td>
  <td>
    Month-to-month revenue changes were primarily driven by changes in transaction volumes rather than pricing or customer mix.
  </td>
  <td>
    Months with revenue growth or decline show strong alignment with transaction movements (e.g., February −9% Txns, March +8% Txns).
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Material Revenue Movements</strong></td>
  <td>
    Meaningful revenue changes occurred only in a limited number of months.
  </td>
  <td>
    Only February (−8%), March (+5%), August (+4%), and October (+4%) exceeded the ±4% materiality threshold.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Revenue Declines</strong></td>
  <td>
    Revenue declines were largely volume-driven and not structural pricing issues.
  </td>
  <td>
    February (−8%) and June (−3%) declines coincided with decreases in transactions and customers, while average revenue per transaction remained stable or improved.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Revenue Increases</strong></td>
  <td>
    Revenue recoveries were driven by higher customer engagement and transaction activity.
  </td>
  <td>
    March, August, and October show simultaneous increases in transactions and customers, with minimal contribution from price changes.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Pricing & Basket Size</strong></td>
  <td>
    Pricing and average basket size played a secondary role in revenue movement.
  </td>
  <td>
    Average revenue per transaction remained relatively stable across the year, with marginal month-to-month variation (±2%).
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Customer Trends</strong></td>
  <td>
    Customer volumes closely tracked transaction trends, reinforcing volume-led performance dynamics.
  </td>
  <td>
    Months with declining customers (February, June, September) align with revenue softening, while recovery months show customer growth.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Operational Interpretation</strong></td>
  <td>
    Most monthly revenue movements reflect normal operational variability rather than structural shifts.
  </td>
  <td>
    Sub-4% revenue changes were classified as noise and excluded from driver analysis.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Strategic Implication</strong></td>
  <td>
    Sustainable revenue growth will depend on increasing transaction activity rather than adjusting prices.
  </td>
  <td>
    No evidence of sustained pricing uplift; transaction growth consistently explains revenue improvements.
  </td>
</tr>
