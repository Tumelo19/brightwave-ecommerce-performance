  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Overall Performance</td>
    <td>
      Revenue remained stable throughout the year, staying within a narrow range of
      approximately <strong>R7.4M to R8.1M per month</strong>, with no sustained growth trend.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Highest & Lowest Months</td>
    <td>
      <strong>January</strong> recorded the highest revenue (<strong>R8.06M</strong>),
      while <strong>February</strong> recorded the lowest after an
      <strong>8% decline (-R619k)</strong>.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Recovery Pattern</td>
    <td>
      A short-term recovery occurred in <strong>March (+5%)</strong>, but gains were not
      consistently maintained in later months.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Mid-Year Volatility</td>
    <td>
      From <strong>April to September</strong>, revenue showed repeated small declines and
      recoveries, indicating volatility rather than steady growth.

  </tr>

  <tr>

</div>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Revenue stability is driven mainly by consistent customer activity.</li>
  <li>Month-to-month revenue changes are mostly driven by transaction volume.</li>

  <li>Only a few months showed material changes greater than ±4%.</li>
  <li>Revenue declines aligned with lower customer and transaction counts.</li>
  <li>Revenue recoveries were supported by increased customer activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Sustainable growth will depend more on increasing demand
and transaction activity than on pricing changes.
