  ### Key Findings
<tr>
  <td>Primary Revenue Driver</td>
  <td>
    Revenue movements were primarily driven by changes in transaction volumes rather than pricing or customer mix.
  </td>
  <td>
    Months with significant revenue changes show strong alignment with transaction movements, while average revenue per transaction remained relatively stable.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Material Revenue Movements</td>
  <td>
    Only a small number of months experienced material revenue changes.
  </td>
  <td>
    February (-8%), March (+5%), August (+4%), and October (+4%) exceeded the ±4% materiality threshold.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Revenue Declines</td>
  <td>
    Revenue declines were largely volume-driven and reflect reduced transaction and customer activity.
  </td>
  <td>
    February and June revenue declines coincided with decreases in both transactions and customers, with no significant deterioration in average revenue per transaction.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Revenue Increases</td>
  <td>
    Revenue increases were driven by improved transaction and customer volumes rather than price changes.
  </td>
  <td>
    March, August, and October show transaction growth supported by stable or marginal changes in average revenue per transaction.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Pricing and Basket Size</td>
  <td>
    Pricing effects and average basket size played a secondary role in revenue performance.
  </td>
  <td>
    Average revenue per transaction fluctuated within a narrow range, indicating limited pricing impact on overall revenue.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Customer Trends</td>
  <td>
    Customer movements closely mirrored transaction trends, reinforcing a volume-led revenue model.
  </td>
  <td>
    Declines in customer counts aligned with revenue softening, while recovery months showed increased customer participation.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Operational Interpretation</td>
  <td>
    Most month-to-month revenue fluctuations represent normal operational variability rather than structural shifts.
  </td>
  <td>
    Sub-4% revenue movements were treated as normal noise and excluded from primary driver classification.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Strategic Implication</td>
  <td>
    Sustainable revenue growth will depend more on increasing transaction activity than on adjusting prices.
  </td>
  <td>
    Transaction growth consistently explains revenue improvements, with limited contribution from pricing or customer mix changes.
  </td>
</tr>
