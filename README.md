<h2>Executive Snapshot: Revenue Performance at a Glance</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Overall Performance:</strong> Revenue remained broadly stable throughout the year, 
    fluctuating within a narrow range of approximately <strong>R7.4M – R8.1M per month</strong>, 
    with <strong>no sustained month-on-month growth trend</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Peak & Lowest Months:</strong> 
    <strong>January</strong> recorded the highest revenue (<strong>R8.06M</strong>), setting the annual baseline, 
    while <strong>February</strong> marked the lowest point following the largest decline 
    (<strong>-8%, -R619k</strong>).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Recovery Pattern:</strong> A partial recovery was observed in 
    <strong>March (+5%, +R389k)</strong>, however gains were not consistently maintained in 
    subsequent months.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Mid-Year Volatility:</strong> Performance from <strong>April to September</strong> showed 
    repeated short-term declines and brief recoveries, indicating 
    <strong>volatility rather than trend-driven growth</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Late-Year Performance:</strong> <strong>August and October</strong> delivered moderate rebounds, 
    but improvements were not sustained over consecutive months.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Executive Interpretation:</strong> The business remains 
    <strong>financially stable</strong>, with revenue movements driven by short-term dynamics. 
    This presents an opportunity to focus on <strong>stabilising mid-year performance</strong>, 
    strengthening customer retention, and converting short-term recoveries into 
    <strong>sustained revenue growth</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>
