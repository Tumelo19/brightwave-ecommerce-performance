<!-- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
<!-- ===================== -->

<h2>Executive Snapshot: Revenue Performance at a Glance</h2>

<p>
BrightWave Retailers’ ecommerce revenue performance over the year remained 
<strong>broadly stable</strong>, fluctuating within a narrow range of approximately 
<strong>R7.4M to R8.1M per month</strong>. While short-term increases and declines were observed, 
there was <strong>no sustained month-on-month growth trend</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The year began strongly, with <strong>January recording the highest revenue (R8.06M)</strong>, 
establishing a solid baseline. This was followed by a notable early-year dip in 
<strong>February (-8%, -R619k)</strong>, representing the largest month-on-month decline. 
A partial recovery occurred in <strong>March (+5%, +R389k)</strong>, although subsequent months 
showed alternating gains and declines rather than consistent upward momentum.
</p>

<p>
Mid-year performance (April to September) was characterized by 
<strong>repeated short-term fluctuations</strong>, indicating volatility rather than trend-driven growth. 
Late-year results showed <strong>moderate rebounds in August and October</strong>, but these gains were 
not sustained into following months.
</p>

<p>
From an executive perspective, the analysis highlights a business that is 
<strong>financially stable</strong> but facing challenges in achieving consistent revenue acceleration. 
This presents an opportunity to focus on <strong>stabilizing mid-year performance</strong>, 
strengthening customer retention, and converting short-term recoveries into 
<strong>sustained revenue growth</strong>.
