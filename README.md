  <h2>Conclusion: Executive Summary</h2>
</div>

<p>
BrightWave Retailers demonstrates a <strong>stable and resilient revenue model</strong>,
characterised by evenly distributed performance across stores and product categories,
and supported by a highly loyal returning customer base.
</p>

<p>
Revenue performance throughout the year shows limited volatility, with most fluctuations
driven by changes in transaction and customer volumes rather than pricing or basket size.
This confirms a <strong>volume-led revenue structure</strong>, where demand generation and
customer engagement play a greater role than pricing strategies.
</p>

<p>
While customer retention strategies are clearly effective, the sharp decline in new
customer acquisition presents a potential long-term growth risk if left unaddressed.
</p>

<h3>Key Strategic Takeaways</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Revenue stability is underpinned by consistent store and category performance</li>
  <li>Transaction volume is the primary driver of revenue change</li>
  <li>Returning customers account for the majority of revenue and ensure stability</li>
  <li>New customer acquisition has weakened significantly over the year</li>
</ul>

<h3>High-Level Recommendations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Strengthen customer acquisition initiatives to rebalance the revenue mix</li>
  <li>Leverage loyal customers through referral and repeat-purchase incentives</li>
  <li>Focus on demand stimulation during mid-year periods of revenue softening</li>
  <li>Maintain balanced pricing and product strategies across stores and categories</li>
</ul>
