<table>
  <caption>Executive Snapshot: Revenue Performance & Key Drivers</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Aspect</th>
    <th>Insight</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Overall Performance</td>
    <td>
     Revenue stayed stable mainly because customer activity stayed similar each month, not because of price changes or business expansion
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Primary Revenue Driver</td>
    <td>
      Month-to-month revenue movements were primarily driven by changes in <strong>transaction volumes</strong>
      rather than pricing or customer mix, indicating a volume-led revenue model.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Material Revenue Movements</td>
    <td>
      Only a limited number of months experienced material revenue changes.
      <strong>February (-8%)</strong>, <strong>March (+5%)</strong>, <strong>August (+4%)</strong>, and
      <strong>October (+4%)</strong> exceeded the ±4% materiality threshold and were therefore analysed in detail.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Revenue Declines</td>
    <td>
      Revenue declines were largely <strong>volume-driven</strong>, reflecting reduced transaction and customer
      activity rather than pricing pressure. <strong>February</strong> and <strong>June</strong> declines coincided
      with decreases in both transactions and customers, while average revenue per transaction remained stable.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Revenue Increases</td>
    <td>
      Revenue recoveries were driven by improvements in <strong>transaction and customer volumes</strong>.
      <strong>March</strong>, <strong>August</strong>, and <strong>October</strong> show transaction-led growth
      supported by stable or marginal changes in average revenue per transaction.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Pricing & Basket Size</td>
    <td>
      Pricing effects and average basket size played a <strong>secondary role</strong> in revenue performance.
      Average revenue per transaction fluctuated within a narrow range, indicating limited pricing impact on
      overall revenue movement.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Customer Trends</td>
    <td>
      Customer volumes closely mirrored transaction trends, reinforcing a <strong>demand-driven revenue structure</strong>.
      Periods of customer decline aligned with revenue softening, while recovery months showed increased customer participation.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Operational Interpretation</td>
    <td>
      Most month-to-month revenue fluctuations represent <strong>normal operational variability</strong> rather
      than structural change. Sub-4% revenue movements were treated as normal noise and excluded from primary
      driver analysis.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Strategic Implication</td>
    <td>
      Sustainable revenue growth will depend more on <strong>increasing transaction activity</strong> than on
      adjusting prices. Strengthening demand, customer engagement, and conversion will be key to translating
      short-term recoveries into sustained growth.

    <th>Insight</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Overall Store Contribution</td>
    <td>
      No single store stands out as a main revenue driver. All stores perform at similar levels, so growth needs to come from the full store network rather than one location
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Top Contributing Stores</td>
    <td>
      <strong>Gauteng Mall</strong> and <strong>Soweto Plaza</strong> were the highest contributors, each accounting
      for approximately <strong>20.3%</strong> of total revenue, closely followed by the remaining locations.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Revenue Balance Across Locations</td>
    <td>
      Revenue performance across stores is highly balanced, with total annual revenue per store ranging narrowly
      between approximately <strong>R18.1M and R18.7M</strong>.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Transaction Volumes</td>
    <td>
      Transaction volumes are broadly similar across all locations, reinforcing the evenly distributed revenue pattern
      and indicating consistent customer demand across regions.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Average Revenue per Transaction</td>
    <td>
      Average revenue per transaction is consistent across stores, ranging between approximately
      <strong>R1,808 and R1,856</strong>, suggesting limited variation in pricing or basket composition by location.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Average Unit Price</td>
    <td>
      Average unit prices are tightly clustered across stores, indicating standardized pricing and a uniform product mix
      across locations.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Monthly Store Performance</td>
    <td>
      Monthly revenue trends show similar movement patterns across all locations, with stores experiencing
      synchronized increases and declines rather than location-specific volatility.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Customer Behaviour</td>
    <td>
      Distinct customer counts at the total level are lower than the sum across individual stores, indicating that
      customers frequently shop at multiple locations and demonstrating strong cross-store engagement.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Operational Interpretation</td>
    <td>
      The absence of significant revenue concentration or divergence suggests that store performance differences are
      driven by normal operational variability rather than structural or geographic advantages.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Strategic Implication</td>
    <td>
      Future revenue growth is more likely to be achieved through network-wide demand stimulation and customer
      engagement initiatives rather than focusing on individual store expansion or pricing changes.

      Revenue does not depend on one product category. All categories contribute similar amounts, which lowers business risk.
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Top Revenue Categories</td>
    <td>
      <strong>Clothing</strong> (25.2%) and <strong>Accessories</strong> (25.1%) were the highest contributors,
      though differences between categories are minimal and not strategically significant.
    </td>

    <td>Revenue Balance Across Categories</td>
    <td>
      Annual revenue per category falls within a narrow range of approximately

      behaviour across product types.

      Average revenue per transaction is consistent across all categories, ranging between approximately

      Comparable performance across categories suggests a diversified and resilient product mix, reducing
      dependency on any single category for revenue generation.

  <tr>
    <td>Strategic Implication</td>

      Future revenue growth can be driven through broad-based category initiatives rather than prioritising a
      single product category, supporting a stable and scalable revenue strategy.

  <tr>
    <td>New Customer Revenue Trend</td>

      New customer revenue is heavily front-loaded, peaking in

  <tr>
    <td>Sales Driver Assessment</td>

      Monthly sales performance is primarily driven by

      the key engine of revenue stability.

  <tr>
    <td>Risk Consideration</td>
    <td>
      Heavy reliance on returning customers presents a potential long-term risk if
      acquisition channels are not revitalised to replenish the customer base.
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Strategic Implication</td>
    <td>
      While retention strategies are clearly effective, future growth will require
